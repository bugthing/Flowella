=head1 VERSION

Version 0.011

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Basic provides basic HTTP authentication for Dancer web
applications.

Add the plugin to your application:

    use Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Basic;

Configure the protected paths and users/passwords in the YAML configuration
file:

    plugins:
      "Auth::Basic":
        paths:
          "/restricted":
            realm: Restricted zone
            user: alice
            password: AlicesPassword
          "/secret/data":
            users:
              alice: AlicesPassword
              bob: BobsPassword

You can also call the C<auth_basic> function in a before filter:

    before sub {
        auth_basic user => 'alice', password => 'AlicesPassword';
    };

or in a route handler:
    
    get '/confidential' => sub {
        auth_basic realm => 'Authorized personnel only',
            users => { 'alice' => 'AlicesPassword', 'bob' => 'BobsPassword' };
        
        # Authenticated
        ...
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Basic adds basic HTTP authentication to Dancer web
applications.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The available configuration options are listed below.

=head2 paths

Defines one or more paths that will be protected, including sub-paths
(so if the path is C<"/restricted">, then C<"/restricted/secret/file.html"> will
also be protected). Each path can have the following parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<password>

Password (if a single user is allowed access).

=item * C<realm>

Realm name that will be displayed in the authentication dialog. Default:
C<"Restricted area">

=item * C<user>

User name (if a single user is allowed access).

=item * C<users>

A list of user names and passwords (if multiple users are allowed access).

=back

Example:

    plugins:
      "Auth::Basic":
        paths:
          "/secret":
            realm: "Top secret documents"
            user: charlie
            password: CharliesPassword
          "/documents":
            realm: "Only for Bob and Tim"
            users:
              bob: BobsPassword
              tim: TimsPassword

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 auth_basic

This function may be called in a before filter or at the beginning of a route
handler. It checks if the client is authorized to access the requested path --
if not, it immediately returns a 401 Unauthorized response to prompt the user to
authenticate.

    auth_basic realm => 'Top secret', user => 'alice',
        password => 'AlicesPassword';

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<realm>

Realm name that will be displayed in the authentication dialog. Default:
C<"Restricted area">

=item * C<password>

Password (if a single user is allowed access).

=item * C<user>

User name (if a single user is allowed access).

=item * C<users>

A hash reference mapping user names to passwords (if multiple users are allowed
access).
